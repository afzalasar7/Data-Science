        "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
        "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Here are the reasons why:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance: By inheriting from the `Exception` class, your custom exception can inherit all the behavior and attributes of the base class. This includes standard exception handling mechanisms and methods like `__str__` and `__repr__`, which can be useful for debugging and providing meaningful error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compatibility: Inheriting from `Exception` ensures that your custom exception is compatible with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. It allows your custom exception to be caught by generic `except` blocks that handle exceptions of the base class or its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Clarity and Consistency: By using the `Exception` class as the base for custom exceptions, you make your code more readable and maintain consistency with the standard exception hierarchy in Python. It helps other developers understand and handle your custom exceptions correctly.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Be specific in exception handling: Catch exceptions that you expect and know how to handle explicitly. Avoid catching broad exceptions like `Exception` unless necessary, as it can mask potential issues or make debugging more difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use multiple except blocks: When handling different exceptions, use separate `except` blocks for each specific exception. This allows you to handle exceptions differently based on the type or specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handle exceptions gracefully: Provide informative error messages or log the exceptions when they occur. This helps in understanding and diagnosing the cause of the exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Avoid silent failures: Do not ignore exceptions without any action. At the very least, log the exceptions or provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use finally blocks: When necessary, use `finally` blocks to ensure that cleanup code or resource release is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reraise exceptions selectively: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it properly, consider reraising the exception using the `raise` statement. This allows the exception to propagate up the call stack, where it can be handled appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keep exception handling minimal: Avoid excessive nesting of try-except blocks. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level in the code hierarchy and avoid catching exceptions too early.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use context managers: Utilize context managers (`with` statement) to ensure proper resource management and automatic cleanup. Context managers can handle exceptions gracefully and release resources even in the presence of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document exception behavior: When defining custom exceptions or functions that raise exceptions, document the expected exceptions and their behavior. This helps other developers understand and handle the exceptions correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "These practices promote robust and maintainable code that handles exceptions effectively and provides a better experience for users and developers."
