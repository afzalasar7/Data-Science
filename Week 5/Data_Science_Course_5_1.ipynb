        "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and jumps to a specific block of code designed to handle that particular exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exceptions differ from syntax errors in the following ways:\n",
        "- Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language, resulting in a failure to compile or parse the code. These errors occur before the code is executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, or using undefined variables.\n",
        "- Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during runtime when a specific condition or event is encountered that disrupts the normal execution of the code. These errors are usually caused by external factors like user input, file access, network issues, etc. Examples of exceptions in Python include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and ValueError.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "When an exception is not handled, it leads to an error message being displayed, and the program terminates abruptly. This behavior is known as an unhandled exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num1 = 10\n",
        "    num2 = 0\n",
        "    result = num1 / num2  # Raises a ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"ValueError occurred!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, a ZeroDivisionError is raised because we are trying to divide a number by zero. Since there is no except block to handle this specific exception, the program terminates and displays the following error message:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides two statements to catch and handle exceptions: `try-except` and `try-except-finally`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `try-except` statement is used to catch and handle exceptions. The code that may raise an exception is enclosed within the `try` block, and one or more `except` blocks are used to specify the actions to be taken when a particular exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "    num2 = int(input(\"Enter another number: \"))\n",
        "    result = num1 / num2\n",
        "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter integers.\")\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the user is prompted to enter two numbers. If the user enters invalid input (non-integer values), a `ValueError` exception is raised. If the user enters zero as the second number, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised. The appropriate except block is executed depending on the exception raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4. Explain with an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. try and else\n",
        "\n",
        "The `try-except-else` statement is used when you want to specify a block of code to be executed only if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, if the user enters valid integer values and the division operation doesn't raise any exceptions, the code inside the `else` block is executed\n",
        "\n",
        " and displays the result. If an exception occurs, the corresponding except block is executed, and the code inside the `else` block is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. finally\n",
        "\n",
        "The `finally` block is used to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "    file.close()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we try to open a file named \"example.txt\" for reading. If the file is found, its content is read and printed. If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs, a message is printed. Regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, the `finally` block is always executed, ensuring that the file is closed.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. raise\n",
        "\n",
        "The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception explicitly. It allows you to create and raise your own exceptions or propagate an existing exception to a higher level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    if not isinstance(name, str):\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, the `greet()` function checks whether the `name` parameter is a string. If it's not a string, a `TypeError` exception is raised using the `raise` statement. In the try block, we call the `greet()` function with a valid string argument and then with an integer argument. The second call raises the `TypeError` exception, which is caught in the except block and an error message is printed.\n",

        "#5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you define yourself by creating a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class or its subclasses. These exceptions allow you to define and handle specific exceptional conditions in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need custom exceptions to handle specific error cases that are not covered by the built-in exceptions. By defining our own exceptions, we can provide more meaningful error messages and take appropriate actions based on those exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class InvalidEmailError(Exception):\n",
        "    pass\n",

        "except InvalidEmailError as e:\n",
        "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we define a custom exception called `InvalidEmailError` by creating a new class that inherits from the base `Exception` class. The `send_email()` function checks whether the email address contains the \"@\" symbol. If not, it raises the `InvalidEmailError` exception with a specific error message. The exception is then caught in the except block, and an appropriate error message is displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
