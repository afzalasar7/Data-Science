        "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of that class. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class should have. The class serves as a blueprint from which objects can be created, and it encapsulates the common characteristics and behaviors of those objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that is created based on the class definition. Objects have their own unique state (attribute values) and can perform actions (method calls) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Let's consider a class called \"Car\" that represents a car blueprint. The Car class may have attributes like \"brand,\" \"model,\" and \"color,\" and methods like \"start_engine,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"stop.\" An object of the Car class could be created as follows:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "car1 = Car()\n",
        "car1.brand = \"Toyota\"\n",
        "car1.model = \"Camry\"\n",
        "car1.color = \"Red\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the Car class defines the blueprint for creating car objects. The car1 object is an instance of the Car class and has its own state defined by the brand, model, and color attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: It is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation provides data hiding and abstraction, allowing objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces without exposing their internal implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inheritance: It is the process by which one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class. Inheritance allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where a subclass (derived class) inherits the attributes and methods of a superclass (base class). This promotes code reuse and supports the concept of specialization and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Polymorphism: It refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects, leading to code flexibility and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Abstraction: It involves the concept of representing complex real-world entities in a simplified manner. Abstraction focuses on defining essential attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It allows programmers to create abstract classes or interfaces that provide a common structure and behavior for related objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __init__() function is used in Python's object-oriented programming to initialize an object's attributes when it is created from a class. It is a special method, also known as the constructor, that is automatically called when an object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of the __init__() function is to set the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes. It takes in the object itself (usually represented by the 'self' parameter) along with other parameters to initialize the object's attributes based on the provided values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Consider a class called \"Person\" that represents a person's information. The __init__() function can be used to initialize the attributes of the Person class, such as name and age.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
        "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
        "print(person1.age)   # Output: 25\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, when the object `person1` is created, the `__init__()` function is automatically called with the provided values for name and age. It initializes the corresponding attributes of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP),\n",
        "\n",
        " 'self' is a convention used to refer to the current instance of a class. It acts as a reference to the object itself within the class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using 'self', we can access and manipulate the attributes and methods of an object from within its class. It allows distinguishing between the instance variables of different objects and prevents naming conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a method is called on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method. By convention, this first argument is named 'self' to refer to the object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self.radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
        "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
        "\n",
        "circle1 = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(circle1.calculate_area())  # Output: 78.5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `calculate_area()` method of the `Circle` class calculates the area of the circle. The `self` parameter allows accessing the `radius` attribute of the object, which is specific to that instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables the reuse of code and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is represented by an \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class (subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors of a base class (superclass). The derived class can add its own specific attributes and methods while inheriting and reusing the common characteristics of the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one base class. It forms a linear hierarchy, where each derived class has only one direct superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
        "print(dog.name)       # Output: Buddy\n",
        "print(dog.sound())    # Output: Woof!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class by defining its own `sound()` method, while inheriting the `name` attribute from the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple base classes. It allows a derived class to combine and inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Base1:\n",
        "    def method1(self):\n",
        "        return \"Method from Base1\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Base2:\n",
        "    def method2(self):\n",
        "        return \"Method from Base2\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Derived(Base1, Base2):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "derived = Derived()\n",
        "print(derived.method1())    # Output: Method from Base1\n",
        "print(derived.method2())    # Output: Method from Base2\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `Derived` class inherits from both the `Base1` and `Base2` classes. It can access methods from both base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Multilevel inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from another derived class. It forms a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Vehicle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
        "    def drive(self):\n",
        "        return \"Driving a car: \" + self.name\n",
        "\n",
        "class SportsCar(Car):\n",
        "    def drive_fast(self):\n",
        "        return \"Driving a sports car at high speed: \" + self.name\n",
        "\n",
        "sports_car = SportsCar(\"Ferrari\")\n",
        "print(sports_car.drive())        # Output\n",
        "\n",
        ": Driving a car: Ferrari\n",
        "print(sports_car.drive_fast())   # Output: Driving a sports car at high speed: Ferrari\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `SportsCar` class inherits from the `Car` class, which in turn inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `SportsCar` class inherits the `drive()` method from the `Car` class and adds its own `drive_fast()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are some examples of different types of inheritance, illustrating how classes can inherit and extend the functionality of other classes in object-oriented programming."
