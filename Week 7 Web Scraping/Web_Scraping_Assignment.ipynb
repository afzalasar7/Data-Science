        "# Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
        "A1. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by parsing and analyzing the HTML or XML code of web pages. It involves automated gathering of data from multiple web pages, transforming it into a structured format, and storing or analyzing it for various purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Web scraping is used for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Collection: Web scraping allows collecting data from websites at scale, eliminating the need for manual data entry. It enables retrieving large amounts of data from various sources quickly and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Analysis and Research: Web scraping enables researchers and analysts to gather data for analysis, market research, sentiment analysis, trend monitoring, and other data-driven investigations. It provides valuable insights and facilitates evidence-based decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Competitor Monitoring: Web scraping helps businesses monitor competitors by extracting data on pricing, product details, customer reviews, promotions, and other relevant information. This enables companies to stay informed about market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
        "A2. Different methods used for web scraping include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Parsing HTML using Regular Expressions: This method involves using regular expressions to match and extract specific patterns from HTML source code. However, it can be complex, error-prone, and challenging to maintain as web page structures change.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using DOM Parsing Libraries: DOM (Document Object Model) parsing libraries like Beautiful Soup, lxml, or PyQuery provide easy-to-use tools for parsing HTML or XML documents. These libraries enable navigating the HTML structure and extracting data based on tags, attributes, or CSS selectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Web Scraping Frameworks: Frameworks like Scrapy provide a higher level of abstraction for web scraping. They offer built-in functionalities for handling requests, parsing HTML, following links, and managing data pipelines. These frameworks simplify the development and organization of web scraping projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
        "A3. Beautiful Soup is a popular Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. It provides convenient methods and classes to extract data from HTML or XML structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beautiful Soup is used for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy Parsing: Beautiful Soup helps in parsing HTML or XML documents, handling common parsing tasks like navigating the document tree, searching for specific elements, and extracting data using CSS selectors or filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Robust HTML Parsing: Beautiful Soup can handle imperfect or poorly formatted HTML code, making it useful for scraping websites with inconsistent HTML structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration with Parsing Libraries: Beautiful Soup integrates well with popular parsing libraries like lxml or html5lib, providing flexibility and efficiency in parsing and extracting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Web Scraping Convenience: Beautiful Soup simplifies web scraping tasks by providing high-level abstractions and convenient methods, making it easier to extract specific data from web pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
        "A4. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used to develop a web application that interacts with users and presents the scraped data in a user-friendly manner. Flask provides the following benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Web Interface: Flask allows the creation of a web interface where users can input search queries, specify parameters, or select options for the web scraping process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Routing and URL Handling: Flask provides routing capabilities to map different URLs to specific functions, allowing users to navigate different pages or access specific functionalities of the web scraping application.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Template Rendering: Flask supports template engines like Jinja2, enabling the dynamic rendering of HTML templates. This allows the presentation of scraped data in a structured and customizable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "- User Authentication and Session Handling: If\n",
        "\n",
        " the web scraping project requires user authentication or session management, Flask provides features and extensions to handle these functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Flask provides the necessary tools to build a web application around the web scraping project, facilitating interaction with users and enhancing the overall user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk:\n",
        "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling web applications and services. Elastic Beanstalk abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on their code without worrying about server management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features of AWS Elastic Beanstalk include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Easy Deployment:** Elastic Beanstalk supports various programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and more.
