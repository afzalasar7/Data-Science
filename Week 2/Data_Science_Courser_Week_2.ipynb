        "## Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can comment your code to provide explanations, add notes, or temporarily disable certain parts of the code. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the program's execution. There are two types of comments in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single-line Comments**: To write a single-line comment, use the `#` character. Anything written after the `#` symbol on the same line is considered a comment. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # This is a single-line comment\n",
        "   print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This line prints a greeting\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In the above code, the comments start with `#` and extend to the end of the line. They are used to provide a brief explanation or clarification for the corresponding code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-line Comments/Documentation Strings**: Multi-line comments are used for longer comments or documentation. In Python, multi-line comments are often referred to as \"documentation strings\" or \"docstrings.\" Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\"` or `'''`) and can span multiple lines. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   \"\"\"\n",
        "   This is a multi-line comment or docstring.\n",
        "   It can span multiple lines and is often used\n",
        "   to provide detailed documentation for functions, classes, or modules.\n",
        "   \"\"\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Docstrings have a special significance in Python. They are commonly used to document functions, classes, and modules, and can be accessed programmatically using the `__doc__` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using single-line comments and multi-line comments (docstrings), you can add clarity, documentation, and notes to your Python code, making it more readable and understandable for both yourself and others who may work with your code.\n"

        "## Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
        "In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is a name that refers to a value or an object in memory. You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). Here's how you declare and assign values to variables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Variable Declaration**: In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare variables before using them. You can simply assign a value to a variable, and Python will create the variable dynamically. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variable Assignment**: To assign a value to a variable, you use the assignment operator (=). The value on the right side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left side. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to the variable x\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multiple Assignment**: Python allows you to assign multiple variables in a single line. You can separate the variables and values using commas. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x, y, z = 10, 20, 30  # Assigns 10 to x, 20 to y, and 30 to z\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Variable Naming**: Variable names in Python can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores. However, they must follow some rules:\n",
        "   - The first character cannot be a digit.\n",
        "   - Variable names are case-sensitive (\"myVar\" and \"myvar\" are different variables).\n",
        "   - It's good practice to use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Valid variable names: `age`, `count`, `total_sum`, `myVar1`, `my_var_2`\n",
        "\n",
        "   Invalid variable names: `1var`, `my-var`, `total-sum`, `myVar@`\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Variable Reassignment**: You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value. The variable will then reference the new value. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10\n",
        "   x = 20  # Reassigns the value 20 to the variable x\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "By using variables, you can store and manipulate data throughout your program. They provide a way to access and refer to values by name, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **int()**: Converts a value to an integer. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = int(3.14)\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: 3\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **float()**: Converts a value to a floating-point number. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = float(\"3.14\")\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: 3.14\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **str()**: Converts a value to a string. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = str(42)\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: \"42\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **list()**: Converts an iterable to a list. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = list((1, 2, 3))\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **tuple()**: Converts an iterable to a tuple. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = tuple([1, 2, 3])\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **dict()**: Converts a sequence of key-value pairs to a dictionary. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = dict([(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')])\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **bool()**: Converts a value to a boolean. It returns `False` for numeric zero values, empty sequences, and `None`; otherwise, it returns `True`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = bool(0)\n",
        "   print(x)  # Output: False\n",

        "\n",
        "To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Python Script**: Use a text editor to create a new file and write your Python code in it. Save the file with a `.py` extension. For example, create a file named `script.py` and add your Python code inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Open the Command Line**: Open the command line or terminal on your computer. The method for opening the command line varies depending on your operating system. For example, on Windows, you can open the command prompt or PowerShell, while on macOS or Linux, you can use the Terminal application.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Navigate to the Script Directory**: Use the `cd` command (change directory) to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is in the `Documents` folder, use the following command:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   cd Documents\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Execute the Python Script**: Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Python script by running the `python` command followed by the name of your script file. For example:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   python script.py\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you might need to specify the version you want to use. In that case, replace `python` with `python3` or `python2`, depending on your setup.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "It's important to ensure that Python is installed on your system and added to the system's PATH environment variable for the `python` command to work properly. If Python is not recognized as a command, you may need to check your Python installation and configuration.\n",
